# Implementation of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm in C++.

We will try to replicate the KNN Classifier class with the same API as the one in the `sklearn` library.

> See: [KNeighborsClassifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.html)

### API to replicate

```python

class sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5, *, weights='uniform', algorithm='auto', leaf_size=30, p=2, metric='minkowski', metric_params=None, n_jobs=None)[source]

```
